# Cloud_Droplet_Dynamics_in_Avizo
Includes python scripts to create Cloud Droplet dynamics visualization images and video animation of the images

> Extract_EulerianMixingRatio.py :- Takes an NetCDF file as input and extracts the desired variable from the file and creates a new NetCDF file with the extracted variable.

> Convert_dat_to_csv.py :- Simple python program to convert files with .dat/.txt extension into CSV files

> Visualization_single_timestep.py :- Python script designed to load Eulerian and Lagrangian data into Avizo and save a snapshot of the visualization obtained. This version creates outputs only for a single timestep of corresponding Eulerian and Lagrangian files.

> Visualization_multi_timesteps.py :-  Python script designed to load Eulerian and Lagrangian data into Avizo and save a snapshot of the visualization obtained. This version loops through the timestep range specified

> Animation_video_from_images.py :- This code takes input as images and produces an animation video using opencv module.

All codes contain instructions when and where required.
